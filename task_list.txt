LeTac-MPC 

    - Find ways to reduce noise from published depth image
        - ROI the image, as most noise is near edges

    - Gather tactile sensing imaging 

 

Orientation estimation and grasping 

    - Add offset to detected centers 

    - Find filter size for contours 

    - See how much new tarp reduces reflectivity

    - See if there's improvement in translating to HSV color space
