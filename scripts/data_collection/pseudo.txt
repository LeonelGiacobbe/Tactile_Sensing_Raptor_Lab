linear approach:

init_opening = 20mm
P_SLIP = 25mm

move_gripper_1 = True
while (gripper_1_opening < P_SLIP and gripper_2_opening < P_SLIP) {
    if move_gripper_1:
        capture gripper 1 image
        capture gripper 2 image
        open gripper 1 slightly
        move_gripper_1 = False
    else:
        capture gripper 1 image
        capture gripper 2 image
        open gripper 2 slightly
        move_gripper_1 = True
}

with this approach, images from gripper 1 and 2 will have
the same variability in position


--------------------------------------
two loops approach

init_opening = 20mm
P_SLIP = 25mm

while(gripper_2_opening < P_SLIP) {
    while(gripper_1_opening < P_SLIP) {
        capture gripper 1 image
        capture gripper 2 image
        open gripper 1 slightly
    }
    send gripper 1 to init_opening
    open gripper 2 slightly
}

with this approach, the images from gripper 1 will have more variability in position,
since for every inner loop the posi of gripper 1 changes. However, the position of gripper 2
stays the same during the inner loop, so it will record n images while staying at the same position.
For example, init_opening = 20, p_slip = 25

gripper1 opening / gripper 2 opening
20              / 20
21              / 20
22              / 20
23              / 20
24              / 20
20              / 21
21              / 21
22              / 21
23              / 21
24              / 21
and so on.
As you can see in this section of a would-be trial, both grippers record 10 images. gripper 1 has 5 different positions, 
while gripper 2 only has two positions (each opening is present twice in gripper 1's data, while its present 5 times
in gripper 2's data)
